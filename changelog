0.5.7.2
	recheck config.php file content, clean a bit the code and add first start message.


0.5.7 
	add addToRenderOnce/includeJs/includeCss functions
	    addToRenderOnce will include once some data into render, includeJs and includeCss use it to include once js and css files into the head.
	adding check for user loged, if the case, automaticaly delete the page cache and caching nothing else of ini file and skeleton
	extract config into a dedicated config.php file, only for easy update of the framework.

0.6
	change use of render words, from nom you only need to put [head] at top start of your <head>, for simplicity and speed improvement,
		the [head] render word will insert meta, title, keywords, description, javascript, jquery and style render words directly
		so now, this render keywords cannot be put twice in the source like before, other render words still multiple usable.

	now a not found skeleton file will use an internal html5 minimal one, define in config.php file.

	showPage is renamed into parsePage and removed from the global api, now just call renderPage(name) to got your page,
		renderPage take optionaly a second argument who's a last action routine, to launch just before the render final replace,
		it can easily be some plugin call, for title management or in place editing routines,

	add the jsmin php extension support, now a page who is completely in cache will get his javascript minified,

	add insertJs/insertCss function to directly insert files content into the head

	remove support for .html page extension, now page will not get any extension at all.

	some other fix, it's a new branch :)
